The training_set.input.txt contains 5712 questions related to agricultural diseases.



Enter the terminal/command prompt



Enter the directory trainning_set in terminal



Then write "make training_set.output"



The tagger will write the output to "training_set.output"




After that for training in CRF++ 0.58 we need only three features dependency_tag  pos and parent_pos tag 




The file tagger.py reads the file "diseases.txt" for selecting them (SELECT)




So in the same terminal now write "python3 tagger.py">"answers.txt" [Don't use "" (just for specifying the commands")] (where answers.txt will contain the necessary features along with the labels(SELECT/DISCARD)




Now answers.txt is the training set for CRF++ 0.58




So now copy this file with name "crf_train.txt" and  move to folder CRF++
where you can train the model.
