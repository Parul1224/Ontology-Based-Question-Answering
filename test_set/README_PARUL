For testing we have 10 test_sets containing the questions for which the keywords have to be identified 



Each test set contains 500_550 questions each




The names of those test sets are of the following form "test_questions4.input.txt", "test_questions1.input.txt" etc.



So for generating the tags for the test_set enter the terminal 



Enter the directory test_set



Write make "test_questions4.output"



For that the output will be stored in "test_questions4.output"




Now we need our featues for the test set so write python3 tagger.py>test_set4.txt




Now the file test_set4.txt is the test set to be trained against CRF++ 0.58 for generating the labels(SELECT/DISCARD) for the keywords




Move to CRF++ 0.58 and copy this file with name test_set4.txt in the folder CRF++ 0.58
