   Pectinophora gossypiella 





कीट





संक्षेप में





                First generation of larvae feeds on squares and flower structures.

              

                Petals are tied together with silk threads.

              

                Second generation later burrows through the boll walls and the lint to reach and feed on seeds.

              

                Boll lint is cut and stained, which results in quality losses.
