   Blumeriella jaapii 





फफूंद





संक्षेप में





                Blurry purple spots appear on the upper side of older leaves.

              

                Brown spots grow on the lower side, later developing into yellow or white cushions.

              

                Leaves turn yellow and the tree defoliates prematurely.

              

                Fruit maturation and quality are affected, when the disease is severe.
