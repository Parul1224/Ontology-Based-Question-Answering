Internal fruit damage appears as white corky areas under the surface and decaying seeds. Feeding may also deform or kill flower buds and shoots, that shrivel and die, significantly reducing yields.

Adults overwinter in protected ground covers. Early in the season, they feed on broadleaf crops or weeds in adjacent fields. Later in the summer, as these alternative hosts dry up, these bugs may fly into the canopy of pome and fruit trees. Adult plant bugs are flattened, semi-oval insects, yellow, green, and dark brown to black in color. The all have a conspicuous yellow or pale green triangle on the back. Adult stink bugs have a flattened shield shape and are gray to brown to green in color. Stink bugs are noisy fliers, with long, piercing-sucking mouth parts. They can be a problem in fruit orchards with ground cover comprised of broadleaf weeds, or in orchards near alfalfa fields or other host plants.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Predators of these pests include big-eyed bugs, damsel bugs, assassin bugs, and collops beetle, as well as the egg predator minute pirate bug.
