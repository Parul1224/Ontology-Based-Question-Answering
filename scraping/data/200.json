In general, they are beneficial organisms, yet when their population reaches a critical number, they can cause plant damage. They are characterized by the presence of a stylet, which they used to penetrate roots and underground parts of plants, and in some cases leaves and flowers. Nematodes have different feeding strategies and can survive several years in the soil. They multiply via intermediate hosts.

In many cases, secondary attacks by fungi or soil bacteria occur at these lesions. Water and nutrients do not reach the aerial parts of the plant. Infested plants have a stunted growth and their leaves may turn chlorotic, with signs of wilting and deformation. Sometimes the stems are also affected.\n            "}
