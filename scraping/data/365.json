They also eat on the young fruit, making scars and spots on the skin that deforms it and makes it unmarketable. Most of the scarring occurs at the base of the fruit, reflecting the fact that beetles chose the most sheltered spots for feeding (under the bract for example). Scars are mostly oval in shape and can be confused with those of the fruit-scarring bee Melipona amalthea. The damage is made worse by the  colonization of the tissues by opportunistic pathogens. The larvae feed on young roots, and tunnel on the older ones to eat their tissues. Occurrence of this pest is usually high during the rainy season. \r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The damage is caused by the banana fruit-scarring beetle, Colaspis hypochlora. Adults have brown forewings with characteristic rows of small parallel dots. They are very good fliers.  Females lay pale lemon-yellow eggs, singly or in clusters varying in number from 5 to 45. Egg-laying is taking place in cavities gnawed in the leaf sheaths near the crown or in natural depressions that expose the surface of roots. After 7 to 9 days, the newly-hatched larvae start to feed on the young roots or to bore tunnels into the soft epidermal tissues of the older roots to feed on them. They have a whitish, slender and hairy body, and the head somewhat amber-colored. The pupa is dirty yellow, becoming darker as the adult becomes ready to emerge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              No biological treatment seems to be available for this pest to this day.
