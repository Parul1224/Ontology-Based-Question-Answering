These specific mites have an elongate body and only two pairs of legs, unlike other mites which have four pairs. They overwinter in the bark or underneath bud scales and start feeding and laying eggs in spring. They feed on leaf tissues by sucking sap and while doing so, they secrete chemicals into the plant tissue, causing the formation of the characteristic galls. Mites keep feeding sucking on these galls, which are actually filled with nutritious plant sap.
