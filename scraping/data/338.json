However, some of these snails, for example B. glabrata, are intermediate hosts for parasites that can also infect humans, so caution is necessary because this snail can be a medically-important pest. This parasite causes a disease called schistosomiasis and it is transmitted by human contact with contaminated fresh water inhabited by snails carrying the parasite (lakes, ponds, rivers, dams, swamps and rice fields). Its spreading is mainly through irrigation canals, streams, drains and flooding. However, due to the special chemistry of the water in springs and wells, these locations are not usually colonized by these snails. Potable water and sanitation facilities are necessary to avoid the damage to local populations.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The damage to rice plants is caused by air-breathing freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria.
