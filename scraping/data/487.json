Initial symptoms appear as small (1-5 mm), circular or elongated white spots on the upper leaf surface. Individual spots and later groups of spots are surrounded by a light green or silvery halo that often has a water-soaked appearance at the beginning. Over time, the number of lesions increase and the center of the older spots becomes sunken and straw-colored, a sign of developing necrosis. A characteristic slit that is oriented lengthwise in the lesion may appear at later stages. Leaf tips and margins soften and gradually become necrotic, resulting in blighting and dieback. In favorable conditions, the disease also affects the bulb, reducing its size and its quality. As the disease spread further, large yellow patches of dying plants can be observed from the distance in the field. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The disease is caused by the fungus Botrytis squamosa, which survives on infected bulbs or other plant debris left in the field, or in storage facilities. When conditions are favorable, fungal spores are produced on these tissues and spread by the wind to neighboring plants, serving as a primary source of infection. Temperatures between 10 and 20 \u00b0C, high rainfall, prolonged periods of leaf wetness or high relative humidities favor the life cycle of the fungus. To avoid severe infections it is very important to keep the leaves as dry as possible. The symptoms may be confused with other pathologies or disorders such as drought stress, hail injury, thrips infestation or herbicide damage.\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              No biological treatment seems to be available at the moment to treat this disease.
