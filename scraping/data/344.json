The feeding on the roots prevents young plants from developing tubesrs, thereby causing premature leaf-fall, wilting and tip dieback. Plants become discolored and shriveled at the feeding sites. Occasionally, the damage can cause the death of the young plant. Those plants that are attacked at later stages develop and grow tubers normally. However, they exhibit smaller mature tuberous roots and become covered in oval-shaped scales, making them unsuitable for sale and reducing the nutrient content. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The damage is caused by the nymphs and adults of the scale insect Stictococcus vayssierei, commonly called cassava root mealybug. They are subterranean insects that can cause infestations of cassava plantations, more severe during the dry season. They also tend to cause problems to farmers when cassava is cultivated in soils rich in iron and aluminum (laterite), in clayey soils, or in soils with a low fertility (poor in nutrients). Good cultural practices are also important. For example, planting in shallow soil preparations or on flat land (instead of furrows) increase the incidence of the disease. Many species of ants, in particular Anoplolepis tenella, actually carry this insect in the soils, and are thus the principal agents for its dispersal. The pathogen is rarely found in newly opened forest farms or mono-culture plantations of manioc. In severe cases, it can pose a major threat to cassava production in Central Africa, causing losses of up to 100%. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Control agents such as endomycorrhizae (associations of beneficial fungi with plants) are under study to determine their usefulness in pest control in some African countries.
