Adult beetles  scrape the upper surface of leaf blades leaving only the lower epidermis. Eggs are laid inside minute slits on the tender leaves, generally toward the tip. The grub is whitish yellow and flattened. It feeds inside the leaf tissue by mining along the leaf axis, and subsequently pupates internally. The adult beetle is somewhat square-shaped, about 3-5 mm in length and width. it is dark blue or blackish in color with spines all over the body. Grassy weeds, heavy fertilization, heavy rains and high relative humidity favor rice hispa infestation.\n            ", "\u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0915 \u0909\u092a\u093e\u092f": "\n              No effective resistance trait to this pest is available in rice.,Use narrower plant spacing with greater leaf densities that can tolerate higher hispa numbers.,Grow crops early in the season to avoid peak populations.,Cut the shoot tip to prevent egg laying.,Remove any kind of weed from the rice field during the crop-free season.,Infested leaves and shoots should be clipped and burned, or buried deep in the mud.,Apply a crop rotation to break the life cycle of the pest.,Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization in infested fields.,Collect adult bugs with a sweeping net, preferably early in the morning when they are less mobile.\n            ", "\u091c\u0948\u0935\u093f\u0915 \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0923": "\n              The biological control of this pest is still under study. The larval parasitoid, Eulophus femoralis, has been introduced in Bangladesh and India and may reduce the hispa problem in these areas. The conservation of indigenous natural enemies may also play an important role in the management of this pest. For example, there are small wasps that attack the eggs and larvae and a reduviid bug that eats on the adults.

The larvae feed on the green tissue between the two epidermis of the leaves, tunneling along the veins and causing white patches. They can be detected by holding the damaged leaf against light or by passing the fingers along the tunnel. Infested leaves dry up, and present a white appearance in the field.
