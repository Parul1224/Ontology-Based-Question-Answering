The first symptoms appear as tiny, whitish, slightly raised spots on the upper surface of leaves. As they enlarge, these spots turn powdery and orange or brown in color, and are often surrounded by a lighter halo. These pustules are to be found on both upper and lower side of leaves, stems and pods. At a later stage, secondary pustules seem to develop within the primary ones, forming an O shape with a dot in their center. The appearance and severity of the rust is greatly dependent on the prevailing weather condition. It develops rapidly on the plant when temperatures are above 20\u00baC and can literally cover it. A heavy infection will result in leaf drop, stunted plant growth and premature death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptom are caused by the fungus Uromyces viciae-fabae, which survives on plant debris, volunteer plants and weeds when no crops are available. It can also be carried on seeds as concomitant contaminations. It has a reduced number of hosts that, beside lentil, also includes broad bean and pea. When conditions are favorable (17 to 25\u00b0C and prolonged leaf wetness), it produces spores that are spread by the wind over large distance to infect new plants or fields. Other means of transmission are the transportation of plant debris between fields, contaminated hay, and the contamination of clothing, tools and machinery. It is regarded as a high economic threat because of its spreading capacity. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              No biological control agents are available to control this pathogen.
