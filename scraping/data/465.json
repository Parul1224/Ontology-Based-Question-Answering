Its symptoms manifest themselves as interveinal yellowing and chlorosis of emerging leaves. If nothing is done to amend the deficiency, whole leaves can become chlorotic, depending on the extent of the deficiency, and then very pale. If the deficiency is severe, the entire rice plant may become chlorotic and die. Affected plants show chimeric root tips and necrotic epidermis. Affected areas can easily be identified from a distance in the field. Leaf chlorosis and necrosis reduce chlorophyll content, inhibit the photosynthetic rate, retard growth and lower the yield potential of the rice plant.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Iron deficiency is relatively rare especially in irrigated rice systems, but can occur throughout the growth cycle of the plant. Young rice plants are particularly susceptible to iron deficiency. It can be a serious problem in calcareous, alkaline soils or in poorly drained soils that flood easily and create anaerobic conditions in the roots. Rice fields in upland soils are most susceptible, but fields in lowlands with low organic matter status or that are irrigated with  alkaline irrigation water are also at risk. The absorption of iron by the plant and the yield response seem to be directly related to the soil pH. Another factor limiting the availability of iron to the plant is excess of heavy metals in the soil. Because iron has low mobility, iron deficiency symptoms appear first on the youngest leaves. Leaf chlorosis and necrosis reduce chlorophyll content, inhibit the photosynthetic rate, retard growth and lower the yield potential of the crop.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              The best way to amend soils poor in iron is to regularly apply organic matter (e.g., crop residues, manure, peat and compost).
