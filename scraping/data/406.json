Wild rye, wheat and volunteers are among the many alternate hosts of this pathogen. The germination process requires leaf moisture, and works best at 100% humidity and warm temperatures (15\u00ba to 22\u00ba C). However, the spores cannot survive hot, dry weathers. Severe attacks of brown rust in rye occur mainly in late season, particularly if high doses of nitrogen have been applied. Crops sown early are more severely infected than those sown later, particularly when nights are still warm. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Biocontrol agents include the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the fungus Trichoderma harizanium or the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae, and can give reasonable control of leaf rust in rye and contribute to an increase in grain yield.\n\n            ", "\u0c30\u0c38\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c28 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23\n": "\n              Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available.
