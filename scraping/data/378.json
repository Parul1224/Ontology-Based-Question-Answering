Despite its name, it is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and, beside the Mediterranean area, it is also present in the Middle East, South and Central America and Australia. The female pierces the soft skin of ripening fruit or berries and lay eggs in the puncture hole, below the skin. After hatching, the larvae feed inside the fruit pulp and usually inflict severe damage that can make it inedible. It is a polyphagous insect, meaning that it feeds on a large range of hosts. It can also easily infest new hosts if the favorite plants are not within reach. There is also evidence that it could transport opportunistic fungi that grow on the attacked fruits. It is a highly invasive species that thrive in many diverse environments and at comparatively wide temperatures, with an optimal range between 10 and 30 \u00b0C. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Some biocontrol using parasitoid insects and predators can be achieved.
