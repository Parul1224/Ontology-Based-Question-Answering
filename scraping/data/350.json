Early damage is similar in appearance to drought damage, with an initial yellowing and dropping of the leaves. Later, the leaves age and the maturing stalks deteriorate. In extreme cases, the whole stool is deprived of its roots and is readily levered out of the ground by its own weight. In some cases, the larvae may tunnel into the cane stalks. In extreme cases the feeding damage of the roots leads to lodging of the cane. Due to the decrease of water supply the leaves may start yellowing.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              All the three larval instars cause feeding damage of the roots, but the third instar is extremely voracious.

Attacks on old cane lead to yield reduction. The larvaes are creamy white colored and C-shaped.
