Sticky, liquid droplets of spore-bearing honeydew, thin to viscous, orange-brown or superficially white, may exude. Under conditions of high relative humidity, the honeydew is of low viscosity and the surface white. The surfaces of the panicle, seed, leaves, stalk and soil also become smeared by the dripping honeydew and appear whitish. A white, powdery crust forms wherever such honeydew dries. The honeydew may be colonized by several types of opportunistic fungi. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the fungus Claviceps africana.
