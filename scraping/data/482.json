The flies overwinter as pupae in the soil and emerge in spring. Adults resemble common houseflies, but are much smaller. They have a black body with a yellow marking on the back. The wings are translucent with black bands and the abdomen is marked with thin white stripes. They feed on pollen and honeydew secreted by the aphids present on the trees. Females lay several eggs under the skin of the developing fruits. After hatching, the whitish larvae start to burrow towards the pit, where they feed for a period of up to three weeks. They then pierce the skin of the fruit and drop to the ground in order to pupate there. There is only one generation per year and hot and dry summers promote infestation of the orchards.  \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Some parasitic wasps have been reported to attack larvae of the cherry fruit fly.

To avoid a negative impact on the populations of beneficial organisms, take the adhesive traps off the tree at the beginning of harvest. Kaolin clay, applied as a spray to leaves, stems, and fruit, acts as a repellant to some insect pests. Bait sprays based on spinosad, pyrethrin or neem compounds mixed with ammonia have also shown good results. Efficacy seems humidity dependent, with best results in dry climate regions.
