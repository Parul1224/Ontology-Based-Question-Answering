Later, this spreads over the whole tree and can lead to complete defoliation. The wilt of leaves normally progresses from the lower leaves to the top, but some plants may drop the whole foliage at once. Vertical stem cracking is common in this disease. Roots, stem bark and particularly lower branches can split. This, or cross and vertical sections of affected plant parts, generally reveals  dark grayish-brown streaks in the vascular tissue.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Spores of the the fungus survive as resting structures or active mycelia in infected plant parts up to 190 days and in the soil for at least four months.

The spores are spread by infected seedlings, irrigation and rain water, insects and during normal field work.
