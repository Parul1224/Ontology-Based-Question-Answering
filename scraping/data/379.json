The larvae bore holes into the stem and carve it out, which leads ultimately to death. The fully grown larva is about 20 mm long and has a reddish-brown head and a white body which can also be black-spotted. The adult moth has a wingspan of about 8 to 15 mm with white wings. The eggs of the stem borer are laid in batches on the leaf and have a yellow color.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              In wet regions there are three generations of larvae per year, while in dry regions two cycles occur.

The \u2018push-pull\u2019 method can be very effective: Crops like Desmodium can be intercropped with millet. Desmodium acts as a repellent, so the moths are \u2018pushed\u2019 away from the millet.
