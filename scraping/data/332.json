These spots are often surrounded by a light green or yellow margin. As they expand, their center turn brown or rust-colored first and eventually falls out, leaving the characteristic \u2018shot hole\u2019 on the limbs that give the disease its name. Premature leaf drop can occur. Twigs may present dead buds, lesions or cankers that exude gum. On fruits, rough and corky lesions with purple margins appear, generally only on the upper surface. This makes the fruit unattractive and unmarketable. Tiny black specks can be observed with a magnifying lens in the middle of the lesions. \r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Symptoms are caused by the fungus Wilsonomyces carpophilus, which infects several species of stone fruits (peach, almond, cherry and apricot).  Alternative hosts are English laurel and nectarines. The fungus overwinters in lesions in buds and twigs or in mummified fruits. When the weather conditions are favorable, they resume growth and produce spores that are dispersed by rain splashes to healthy tissues. Extended periods of leaf wetness (14-24 hours or more) and temperature around 22 \u00b0C favors the life cycle of the fungus and its potential to infect healthy trees. Warm, foggy or rainy winters and heavy spring rains favor the formation and release of spores. The disease will actually develop on stone fruits trees only during unusually wet weather during the spring. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Spraying of fungicides based on copper in early winter can be the first defense against the disease.
