Long, narrow, uniform and watery-green stripes occur first near the midrib and the base of leaf blades. At later stages of the disease, stripes spread across the whole leaf, coalesce and become first light- and then dark-red in colour (necrotic). Leaves wilt, rot and emit a strong, unpleasant odour. As the rotting progresses into the stem, large cavities form within the internodes. At later stages of the disease, tops and inflorescences frequently break off and fall to the ground, this symptom is called top rot.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The bacteria prefers high humidity and high temperatures.
