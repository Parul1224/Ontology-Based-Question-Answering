As the leaves gradually open during the vegetative stage, they show feeding patterns in the form of yellow spots or strikes on inner margins, white or transparent patches, and pinholes. Damaged leaves become distorted and may be broken off by the wind. The larvae can also cause damage to the flag leaf, showing as small punctures on the blade and discolored margins. If they reach the developing panicles, a partial  filling of grains may be observed. Usually,  rice plants can compensate for the damage caused by the whorl maggot and the symptoms disappear during the maximum tillering stage of the crop.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the larvae of the semi-aquatic whorl maggot, Hydrellia philippina. It is a member of a family of leaf miners, with the difference that it mines the unfurled leaf before it expands, thus creating a unique pattern of necrotic lesion on the blade. It is common in irrigated fields, ponds, streams and lakes or places with abundant calm water and lush vegetation. The year-round cultivation of rice, and the transplanting of young seedlings also favor its development. However, it does not thrive in direct-seeded fields, seedbeds or drained fields. The full-grown maggots pupate outside the feeding stalk. The primary host is rice but it can also breed on species of grasses such as Brachiaria sp., Cynodon sp., Echinochloa sp., Leersia sp., Panicum sp., and wild rice.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Small wasps of the genus Opius, Tetrastichus and Trichogramma parasitize the eggs and the maggots.
