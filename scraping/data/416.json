They are also easily transported by the wind over long distances, to newly-planted rice fields. Females have a longevity of 13 days, and during that time lay about 25-150 eggs, primarily in the youngest leaf of the rice plant. Eggs are inserted into the slits of leaf blade tissue, the upper half remaining exposed. After hatching, young larvae feed on the soft tissues of unopened young leaves. Normally, all stages remain inside the rolled leaves, even the mobile adults. Periods of dry weather favor the development of the rice thrips and increase the severity of the damage. Having no standing water in the rice fields also encourages damage.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Encourage natural predators of S. biformis, such as predatory thrips, coccinellid beetles, anthocorid bugs, and staphylinid beetles.
