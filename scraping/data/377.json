They eat irregular and often large holes in leaves but can also affect stems, flowers, tubers and bulbs. The damage can be traced back to these animals thanks to the silvery slime trails found on plant foliage and soil surface. They mainly occur in humid weather conditions and they are particularly keen on young tender plants. They can actually kill young seedlings by completely eating them.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Snails and slugs feed on decaying organic matter, and on leaves, roots and tubers of a variety of crops. Slugs are underground dwellers, using cracks and tunnels made by plant stems or worms, and only come to the surface to mate. In potatoes, they can make round superficial holes in the skin or dig extensive cavities into the tubers, causing considerable damage. These animals thrive in wet weather conditions, so the infestation occurs mainly after dewy nights or after rainfalls. Most species survive mild winters and become active again in spring.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Predators such as hedgehogs, birds, frogs, toads, blindworms and ground beetles should be encouraged through good field management practices.
