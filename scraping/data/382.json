These  pathogens can survive in the soil in the absence of their favorite hosts. Under favorable conditions, they resume growth and start to colonize roots through small rootlets or wounds. The incidence of these fungi on the roots of diseased trees and the severity of the symptoms depend on the geographical location and the environmental conditions. Rhizoctonia is a soil-borne fungus favored by warm, moderately moist soil conditions. However, the disease can occur in both dry and moist soils. Most of the symptoms of root rot found in olive trees are actually triggered by other fungi, mainly species belonging to the genus Fusarium. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Sorry, we don't know of any alternative treatment against Rhizoctonia solani.
