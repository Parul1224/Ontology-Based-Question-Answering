Old larvae actually cause the worst damage because they feed mainly under the sepals of young fruits. As fruit grow, the damaged rind extends outward from beneath the sepals and becomes a conspicuous ring of scarred tissue. Fruit are most susceptible to damage from shortly after petal fall until they are about 3.7 cm in diameter. The risk of attack by thrips is higher on the fruits located on the outside of the canopy, where they are also susceptible to wind damage and sunburn. The texture of the pulp and the characteristics of the juice may be unaffected, but the fruits may be unmarketable. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The damage is caused by the citrus thrip, Scirtothrips citri. Adults are small, orange-yellow with fringed wings. During spring and summer, females lay about 250 eggs in new leaf tissue, young fruit, or green twigs. In fall, overwintering eggs are laid mostly in the last growth flush of the season. These eggs will hatch in the next spring about the time of the new growth in the trees. Young larvae are very small, whereas older ones are about the size of adults, spindle-shaped, and wingless. Last larval stages (pupa) thrips do not feed and complete their development on the ground or in the crevices of trees. When adults emerge, they move actively around the tree foliage. Citrus thrips do not develop below 14\u00b0C and they can produce 8 to 12 generations during the year if the weather is favorable. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              The predatory mite Euseius tularensis, spiders, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs attack citrus thrips.
