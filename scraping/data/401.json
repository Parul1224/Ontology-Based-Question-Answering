Symptoms of an attack by these mites include the presence of spots on leaves, leaf discoloration and a curling along the midsection that give them the shape of a sickle. Other signs of an infestation are dead vegetative buds in spring, discoloration of flower buds, blossom blasting and abscission, and reduced shoot growth. Young leave internodes may be malformed causing a \u2018witch\u2019s broom\u2019 effect when observed from the distance. This pest is usually not a major problem as the olive tree will be able to stand the infection and recuperate on its own.

It is a minute organism (0.1-0.2 mm) that is not visible to the naked eye. It is yellowish to dark tan, slow moving, and has a wedge-shaped, flattened body that is typical of many species of this family.  Since they feed exclusively on olive orchards, their life cycle is closely related to that of the olive tree. In the spring, they move to new leaves and buds to reproduce and females lay about 50 eggs there. Emerging larvae and nymphs feed in numbers on flowers and can severe the stalks, making them to fall prematurely. Later, the mites can attack young fruits and cause discoloration and shriveling of the tissues around the feeding sites. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Lady beetles and some types of predatory mites feed on O. maxwelli and can be introduced in orchards.
