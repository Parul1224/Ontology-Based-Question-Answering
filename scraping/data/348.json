Midrib and veins remain green (interveinal chlorosis). Neither leaf tips and margins are affected in those early stages. After the application of foliar fertilizers containing iron veins are the first to recover, showing a bright green color. This re-greening of the veins after the application of iron is the most recognizable symptom of this disorder. In severe deficiencies, the chlorosis extends to the whole lamina and leaves gradually take a bleached aspect. However, necrosis does not appear. No symptoms are reported on tubers. \r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Iron deficiency can be a problem in water-logged soils, calcareous soils or, in general, in soils with a high pH. In clay soils, iron becomes fastened to particles and is not readily available to the plant. The presence of heavy metals can also compromise the uptake of iron. Because iron has a low mobility, iron deficiency symptoms appear first on the youngest leaves. Iron plays an important role in photosynthesis and plant metabolism. Leaf chlorosis reduces chlorophyll content, inhibits the photosynthetic rate, and retards the growth of the potato plant. However, in some varieties of potato, the deficiency does not seem to have an adverse affect on yield or quality of the tubers. The optimal pH range for iron availability is below 6.25. There is a gradual decrease in availability as pH increases until about pH 8.25. \r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Organic matter in animal manures, peat and composts can be used as an effective measure to add iron and other nutrients to the soil.
