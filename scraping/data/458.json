Later, each larva web several flower buds together with silk threads, forming structures called \"glomerules\" visible to the naked eye. As they feed on the flowers inside their shelter, they produce abundant frass that is clearly visible to the naked eye. Second-generation larvae (mid summer) first feed externally on green berries. They later penetrate them and hollow them out, leaving only the skin and seeds. Third-generation larvae (late summer) cause the greatest damage by feeding inside the berries and within bunches, which then gradually dry. Silk threads are spun between the berries to prevent them from falling. The feeding damage exposes them to infection by several types of opportunistic fungi or attacks by insects e.g. raisin moth (Cadra figulilella), fruit flies, and ants. Larval damage on growing points, shoots or leaves is unusual.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana. Pupae overwinter inside silken cocoons under the bark, on the underside of dry leaves, in cracks on the soil or on vine debris. Adults have mosaic-patterned forewings, tan-cream in color, mottled with gray, brown, and black blotches. The second pair of wings is gray with a fringed border. Adults of the first generation emerge when air temperatures exceed a threshold of 10\u00b0C for a period of 10 to 12 days. Optimal development conditions are 26-29\u00b0C humidities ranging from 40 to 70%. Larvae perforates the flower envelopes to penetrates the bud and can even enter the peduncle of the bunch of grapes, causing it to dry. Older caterpillars web fruit together with silk threads, then nibble them or penetrate them.
