Orange coloured dots of bacteria, resembling pinheads are present on the internal soft tissue in the nodal region. Later on, the disease is characterized by stunted growth, thin stalks with short internodes, pale yellowish foliage and rapid tapering of the stem towards the top.The node can turn yellow to reddish-brown, dependent on weather and cultivar. The discoloration does not extend to the internodes. Some highly susceptible cultivars may show wilting under moisture stress and even necrosis of leaves at the tips and margins.
