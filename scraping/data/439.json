Later, these lesions extend to the midvein of leaves and to the twigs surrounding the base of the petiole. Later on, the leaves dry and curl, but still remain firmly attached to the branch. Eventually they fall, usually without petioles. The necrotic areas on twigs further enlarge and the twigs may be  eventually killed within 20-30 days if they become completely girdled. Nursery stocks may become blighted in question of days, the symptoms being somewhat similar to those caused by Phytophthora attack. The symptoms are less severe or may even revert with the onset of warm or dry weather. Fruit infection is seen occasionally in oranges in the form of small black pits on the skin. Orange, lemon and mandarin trees show the worst symptoms. \r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Citrus blast is caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which infect several citrus varieties. These bacteria usually dwell on the surface of the leaves and become pathogenic during prolonged periods of wet weather. It enters plant tissues through the leaf natural pores or leaf scars or via wounds in stems. Injuries to tissues, such as those occurring during wind, driving rain, sandblasting and frost, facilitate the entry of the bacteria into the plant. Several days of prolonged leaf moisture appear to be required for infection to take place. Young leaves that have not completely matured or hardened off before winter are most susceptible. \r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              As of today, no biological treatment is known to control the incidence or severity of this disease.
