As  populations increase, they will also chose the surface of mature leaf blades. The incubation period is 3-8 days. The newly hatched nymphs are minute, with a reddish body that later turn yellowish brown. Nymphs entering the metamorphic process drop off of the plant and then complete their development in loose soil or leaf litter at the base of their host. Pupal period lasts 2-5 days.
