They have small, transparent midge pupal cases attached to the tip of the damaged spikelets. When squashed, red ooze appears, deriving from the body contents of the midge larva or pupa.

Adult midges have a mosquito-like appearance, with a bright orange body, transparent wings and very long antennae. When the temperatures and humidity rise, they come out of their diapause in the grain and mate within an hour. Shortly after that, the females lay 1 to 5 small, cylindrical and transparent eggs in each spikelet. The eggs hatch within 2 to 3 days and the young, colorless larvae begin to feed  on the soft tissue of the developing grain. After 10-15 days of continuous feeding, the mature dark-orange larvae pupate inside the grain for 3 to 5 days before emerging as an adult and start the cycle over again. Following the harvest, the larvae that are still in the grain enter into diapause where they can remain resting for up to 3 years. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Small black parasitic wasps of the families Eupelmus, Eupelmidae, Tetrastichus and Aprostocetus (A. diplosidis, A.

In the field, chemical control of the midge can be difficult because the larvae, pupae and eggs are protected inside the spikelets. Pesticide use has to be carefully timed so as to occur when the adults emerge in the morning during flowering. In other conditions, the treatment will be ineffective. Formulations containing chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, cythalothrin, esfenvalerate, malathion or methomyl can be used.
