They also nibble at the shoots and florets or at the base of the inflorescence stalks, causing formation of white ears and often severing the panicles. The feeding marks on leaves and shoots, the large portions of leaf edges consumed, and the cut-off panicles are characteristic of this species and can help differentiate it from other leaf eaters, such as locusts. The presence of eggs in rice pods and of yellow and brown nymphs and adults feeding on rice foliage is further symptomatic for the pest.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The characteristic symptoms (scratched leaf tissues, large portions of leaf blade missing, white ears and severed panicles) are caused by the nymphs and adults of the rice grasshopper, Oxya hyla intricata, also commonly known as  the rice short-horned grasshopper. Aquatic environments are suitable for their development and therefore, they are common in moist and swampy areas. Adults are emerald green with a black band on the thorax extending to the wings. Females lay yellow, capsule-shaped eggs on the rice foliage, in compact masses covered with a white secretion to protect them from drying out. Under unfavorable conditions, the adults develop wings, swarm and migrate.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Biological control agents which occur naturally such as wasps, parasitic flies and worms, ants, birds, frogs, web-spinning spiders should be promoted.
