Tips become necrotic, torn and roll inwards while the base of the leaf remains green and healthy. Eventually the tip of the leaf dies and may twist back or fall off. Plants are stunted with short stout stems but older leaves remain dark green and erected. In severe deficiencies, main roots and laterals roots have reduced growth.  Unlike Ca deficiency, Cu deficiency affects principally older leaves, which become pale green or chlorotic, wilted and may wither over time. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Symptoms are generally related to the availability of this nutrient to the plant rather than to low soil supply. Calcium is not mobile in the plant and its absorption is tightly linked to the uptake and transport of water. Heavy soils and irrigated soils are good at dissolving calcium and bringing it to the plant. However, sandy soils, with a poor water retention capacity, are prone to drought and can limit its uptake. Allowing the soil to dry out too much between waterings can also cause the symptoms. Soils with low pH, high salinity or soils rich in ammonium can also be problematic. High air humidity, drought or flooding of soils can also slow down the transport of water to tissues. Generally, the optimum soil pH range for a good calcium uptake is between 7.0 and 8.5.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              For small farmers or gardeners, crushed eggshells ground very finely and mixed with a weak acid (vinegar) can be used.
