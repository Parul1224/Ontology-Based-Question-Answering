They occasionally also eat grains, seeds and berries. When there is shortage of food, they might chew on the bark of young trees and shrubs. The damage to the roots and stems reduces the flow of nutrients and water to aerial parts of plants. Leaves can show wilting and withering, and signs of overall poor vigor. Girdling damage to the bark reduces yields and might even kill the plants.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The word 'Vole' actually applies to a number of different animals of the Cricetidae family, ubiquitous to the northern hemisphere. They are small, sturdily-built rodents with light brown to gray fur, and similar to mice but with rounder heads and shorter, hairy tails. They thrive in fields with lots of weeds and coverage, especially those with loose and medium-density soils. Voles are active during spring and dig many short and shallow burrows into the soil, eating bulbs, roots and young tubers standing in the way. Using leaves, grass, and stems they build their nests underground, often at the base of a tree or shrub.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Supplemental competitive feeding of the rodents may avoid severe damage to crops.
