Moths emerge during the midsummer. They have a white, long and narrow body with a 16 to 20 mm wingspan. The white, fringed forewings are speckled with small black spots whereas hindwings are grayish, also ended with fringed margins. Females lay yellowish eggs in clusters, in overlapping rows forming a sort of nest on the bark, close to buds or twig junctions. The larvae emerge at bud break and start mining the leaves. They are greenish-yellow, about 20 mm long and with two rows of black spots along their body. They feed gregariously within communal \"tents\" built from leaves webbed together. After having gone through several larval stages, the caterpillar pupate in spindle-shaped, silky cocoons hanging in groups from the leaves.
