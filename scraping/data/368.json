Rhizoctonia solani is a common soil inhabitant that can infect numerous plant species, including potato, onion, green bean, corn, radish, and a variety of weeds. The pathogen survives between lettuce crops in soil and crop debris, or on alternate hosts. It also can be introduced into fields by wind- or water-disseminated spores.
