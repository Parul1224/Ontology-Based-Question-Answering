At later stages of crop growth, first symptoms usually appear on young leaves, which turn pale green or chlorotic. In severe cases, the entire plant becomes lemon yellow and stems may become reddish or purplish. Plants lack vigor and have reduced tillering, leading to a spindly growth. Flowering is retarded and maturity delayed by about 3-10 days. The heads have fewer grains, and those present have poor quality (less rich in proteins). Unless sulfur is applied as part of a fertilization program, yields will be affected. This deficiency differs from nitrogen deficiency in that it is the young leaves that show chlorosis first. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Sulfur is mobile in the soil and can be easily leached downwards with water movements. That explains why deficiencies are often associated with heavy rain periods, light sandy soils with low organic matter, and relatively low pH. Sulfur is only absorbed by the plant in the form of sulphate, which appears during decomposition of organic sulfur  compounds.  Bacteria in the soil make it available to plants in a process know as mineralization. This process is favored by high temperatures because of the enhanced activity of these microorganisms and their increased number. Cold, wet conditions slow the mineralization process. Sulfur is not readily transported from older leaves to young ones, explaining why symptoms first appears on new growth. Volcanoes and fossil-fuel burning power plants are also sources of sulfur. \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              A compost mix of animal manure and leaves or composted mushroom fertilizers is ideal to provide plants with organic matter and nutrients such as sulfur and boron.

It could be a good idea to check first the pH of the soil and lower it with sulfur, saltpeter phosphor or citric acid if it were too high. Top-dressing 10-15 kilograms per hectare of sulfur as gypsum or ammonium sulphate will overcome deficiency symptoms. Plant response to this application may last from 3-4 days to up to weeks depending on weather conditions. Maintaining a high organic matter content in the soil will also help promote sulfur availability to the roots and decrease the amount of nutrients leached.
