However, it is the young, rapidly growing tissues that are most affected. On the leaves, small brown spots develop on the upper lamina. As they enlarge, they become irregular and their center gradually turns gray and necrotic. Eventually, the dead tissue falls out, creating a shot-hole effect. The same type of spots and lesions appear on stems and shoots and can girdle them, resulting in the formation of cankers and dieback. Small, round, purple spots also develop on the  fruits. They gradually expand and turn sunken and ashy gray with brown margins. As they cover the skin, the berries wither and can drop or become mummified on the cluster. The distinctive spots with ashy gray centers confer to the disease its common name, bird\u2019s eye rot. \r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the fungus Elsinoe ampelina. It overwinters in fungal structures on the shoots and the bark of the infected vines. During the spring, it starts to produce spores that are released and dispersed by rain splashes. Wind and rain carry the spores to young, developing leaves or shoots. Periods of prolonged tissue wetness (12 hours or more) and temperatures from 2 to up to 32 \u00b0C favor the production and germination of the spores. The higher the temperature and the humidity, the faster infection will occur and the sooner the symptoms will appear. Cool weather slows the growth of the fungus. Leaf defoliation and direct fruit damage have a serious impact on the yield and quality of the berries. \r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              The application of liquid lime sulfur or copper sprays in early spring, prior to bud break, has been used to avoid a high incidence of the pathogen.
