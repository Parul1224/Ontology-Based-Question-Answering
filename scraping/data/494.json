Oval, gray to tan-colored necrotic patches with dark brown margins develop on the older leaflets. In severe cases, these leaflets wilt, dry and fall off, causing defoliation of the plant. On stems, lesions are elongated, sunken and brownish with darker margins. As they enlarge, the lesions may cover the base of the stem and girdle it, causing the plant to wilt and die. Pods have circular and sunken lesions with reddish-brown margins and reddish centers. In all cases, small distinctive dark or black specks are visible on the dead tissue. Occasionally, a salmon-colored ooze may also appear in the center. Infected seeds are shriveled and discolored. Overall, plant vigor is drastically reduced and they may lodge during adverse weather conditions. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the fungus Colletotrichum truncatum, that survives associated to seeds, in the soil or on plant debris for up to four years. There are two ways by which the infection is carried over to new plants. Primary infections happen when spores that grow in the soil infect seedling during emergence, growing systemically in the tissues. On other cases, the spores are splashed onto the lower leaves by rain drops and start an infection that spread upward. The fungus later produces more spores within the lesions developing on plant tissues (dark or black specks). These are dispersed by rain splashes to upper plant parts or to other plants (secondary infection). Cool to warm temperatures (optimal 20 to 24 \u00b0C), soils with high pH, prolonged leaf wetness (18 to 24 hours), frequent rain and dense canopies favor the disease. Nutritionally stressed crops are especially susceptible. In worst cases, yield losses can be as high as 50%. \r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              For some related species of fungus (on other crops), a certain control of the disease have been reached by soaking infested seeds in 52\u00b0C hot water for 30 minutes.
