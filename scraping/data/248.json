It is different from those that affect other crops such as soybean or pepper. In the field it is often difficult to differentiate Cercospora leaf spot from other foliar diseases, such as target spot. However, the specificity of this disease lies in the fact that it is often found in cotton plants undergoing episodes of stress such as drought or nutrient deficiency (mainly potassium). Maintaining plant vigor by having a proper fertilization scheme and preventing drought stress through proper irrigation helps to delay primary infections significantly. It will also reduce the severity of the outbreaks. The disease is favored by temperatures between 20-30 \u00b0C and high relative humidity. Spores are dispersed onto healthy leaves by wind and water splashing.\n            ", "\u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0915 \u0909\u092a\u093e\u092f": "\n              Use resistant or tolerant varieties, if available.,Regularly monitor for symptoms of the disease.,Remove and destroy affected plant material and destroy it in distance to the field.,Maintain a balanced fertilization (especially apply potassium) and proper irrigation to reduce plant stress.,Remove and destroy plant residues after harvesting by deep burying or burning in distance of the field.\n            ", "\u091c\u0948\u0935\u093f\u0915 \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0923": "\n              To this day, no biological control methods are know.
