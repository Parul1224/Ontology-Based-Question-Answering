In heavy infestations, the virtually irremovable, subrectangular blackscales and their white crawlers literally covers fruit, leaves and shoots. The depletion of plant sap leads to reduced host vigor and the development of yellow spots or streaks on the feeding sites. Its feeding kills branches and may seriously affect the development of fruits, often leading to deformation. This may result in premature senescence, leaf and fruit drop, and the reduction of the quantity and quality of fruits. The species has become the most important pest of Citrus. \r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the scale Parlatoria ziziphi, whose has mainly citrus species as hosts.

This number also depends greatly on the citrus growing areas.
