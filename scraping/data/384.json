While feeding, nymphs and adults produce considerable amounts of honeydew that is later mixed with dust and colonized by sooty mold. Large infestations blacken entire leaves and trees, including fruit, and attract ants, which interfere with the biological control of whiteflies and other pests. The sooty mold also reduces photosynthesis and tree performance. Adult woolly whiteflies are not as active as other whitefly species and will reluctantly fly when disturbed.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the woolly whitefly, Aleurothrixus floccosus. Adults are approximately 1.5 mm in length, with a yellow-white body and wings that are covered with a white waxy (woolly) powder. Females lay eggs in a circle or a semi-circle, into the underside of young, fully-extended leaves, usually in the inner canopy. Their life cycle can be completed in 21-24 days depending on the weather conditions, completing 5-6 annual generations in warm climates. The main damage to citrus is through the production of large amounts of honeydew during the feeding process. This sugary substance is colonized by sootymold fungi whose dark layers interfere with leaf photosynthesis and thus tree performance. During heavy infestations the leaves may have a white-black appearance, due to the intermittent occurrence of adults and sooty mold.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Water, insecticidal soaps and organic horticultural oils can be blasted against the nymphs, killing them on contact.
