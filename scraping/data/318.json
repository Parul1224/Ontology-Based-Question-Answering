Lesions are elliptical or diamond-shaped, and approximately 2.5 mm in diameter. They are often surrounded by a yellow chlorotic halo which will turn necrotic as they grow, giving the appearance of concentric rings. Culms may also be affected, usually at the leaf sheath, and tend to collapse in case of severe infection. Ears, affected by the neck, become unstable, and if they develop at all, grains are shriveled. In severe infections, the extensive chlorosis results in premature drying of young leaves. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. It may persist in plant debris or in shriveled grains of infected ears. It spreads mainly via air-borne spores, initially coming from weeds or other cereal plants serving as alternative hosts. Infected seeds  can give rise to infections in the nursery, later spreading to the main field. Under humid conditions and warm temperatures, the disease is highly favored and features olive-gray overgrowth containing the spores. Germination, formation of spores and invasion of host cells is greatest at 25 \u00b0C. Since the grains from diseased heads carry the fungus, seeds should not be used for the next seasons. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Application of Bordeaux mixture is recommended at 8-10 day intervals in the nursery, and at 14 day intervals in the main field.
