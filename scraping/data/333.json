Unripe fruits that are still attached to the plant for up to one week past the scheduled harvest are not susceptible. Harvested fruits may may also hold for 1 to 4 days depending on the variety. In ripe fruit, damage usually consists of breakdown of tissues and internal rotting associated with maggot infestation. Following oviposition there may also be some necrosis around the puncture marks ('sting'). The mechanical damage to fruits (or by other means) compromises the integrity of the skin and may favor the oviposition into the fruit flesh. \r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The damage is caused by the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis. The color of the fly is very variable, but there are predominantly yellow and dark brown complemented with black markings on the thorax. The development from egg to adult under summer conditions requires about 16 days but this period may be extended considerably by cool weather. Females can lay from 1,200 to 1,500 eggs into ripe fruits during her lifetime, causing considerable damage if left unchecked. After feeding on the banana flesh, the mature larva emerges from the fruit, drops to the ground, and forms a tan to dark brown pupa. Nine days are required for adults to reach their sexual maturity after emergence. Beside banana, avocado, mango and papaya are the most commonly attacked. Other hosts include stone fruits, citrus, coffee, fig, guava, passion fruit, pear, persimmon, pineapple and tomato. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Sterile males of Bactrocera dorsalis have been used in Japan to eradicate the fly from plantations, combined with traps.
