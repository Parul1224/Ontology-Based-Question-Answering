Through the sucking of the leaf sap, it causes white speckles on the upper surface which eventually turn yellow or brown as they dry up. This characteristic is called leaf stippling. Under severe conditions, the whole leaf turns grayish-white and dries up. The mite also spins a very delicate web on the lower surface of the leaf blade, that appears as a powdery substance. Infected plants appear light yellow or pale from a distance due to chlorophyll loss, as the mite pierces the leaf tissue and sucks the exuding sap.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the rice leaf mite, Oligonychus oryzae. \r\nThe damage is most serious during periods of high temperature (25\u00b0 C and above) and high relative humidity. The mites' entire life cycle can take 8-18 days, depending on the environmental conditions. Adults are sexually mature when they emerge and mate as soon as possible. Eggs are laid individually on the lower side of the leaves, in rows along the leaf midribs and veins. Incubation lasts 4-9 days. Severe attacks also take place on the wetland weed commonly found with rice (Echinochloa colona), which may be an alternate host. Since they are difficult to treat, usually their infestation will reoccur in the succeeding year in a rice field, where the incidence was noticed during the previous year.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Biological alternatives include the treatment of seeds with bacteria of the Pseudomonas type at 10 grams/ 1kg of seeds.
