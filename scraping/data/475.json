Interveinal chlorosis occurs on the upper surface of maturing leaves. Small, light brown, slightly raised specks gradually appear on the underside of the leaf beneath the chlorotic tissues. These early symptoms may be limited to a single branch. The chlorotic areas gradually enlarge toward the leaf margin, and the lesions on the underside of the leaf may become dark brown or necrotic. Affected trees exhibit reduced vigor and may appear stunted, but usually they do not die. Defoliation starts at the terminal twigs, usually with younger leaves. Fruits may exhibit sunburn damage or discolor due to the defoliation of the branches. They may also have hard rinds, lack juice and its flesh may have an acidic flavor.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms of citrus variegated chlorosis are caused by the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa. It is a systemic disease that resides in the vascular pipes of the trees (called xylem), thus spreading to the canopy and fruits, including seeds. It is transmitted from tree to tree in a persistent manner by several insects of the family of the Cicadellidae (sharpshooters). These leafhoppers feed on the sap contained in the plant xylem and may acquire the bacteria within two hours of feeding. Their high rate of feeding and the fact that they do not suffer  themselves from the disease makes them the perfect vector. The first symptoms may appear up to one year after infection and this can difficult the identification and treatments.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Some parasitic wasps of the genus Gonatocerus have been used to control populations of sharpshooters.
