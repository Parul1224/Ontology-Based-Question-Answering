Minute pale-green, scale-like nymphs are attached there too. The feeding activity of both adults and nymphs damage the plant tissues and leaves tiny lesions. In case of severe infestations, the drops of sticky honeydew excreted by this pest are colonized by sooty molds and are visible as gray or dark deposition. The cabbage whitefly only infests outer leaves and usually causes little real damage to the parts of the plant that are consumed. However, the sooty molds could affect flower buds, or example on Brussels sprouts, and prevent leaves from photosynthesizing, reducing the productivity of the plant. \r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the adults and larvae (also called nymphs) of the whitefly Aleyrodes proletella. Both have sucking mouthparts that allow them to pierce the plant tissues and feed on the sap, which is rich in sugars. The excess sugary liquid, called honeydew, is excreted on the leaf lamina. This makes the plant leaves sticky and favors the growth of black sooty mold fungi. Adults are covered with white wax and each forewing has two characteristic black marks. Females glue oval eggs a with a yellow spot inside in semicircle on the underside of leaves. After hatching, the nymphs crawl to the nearest vein and start to suck the sap from there. The development of larvae and flies as well as the quantity of eggs depend very much on the temperature. Several generations can develop over a year if warm conditions prevail. Usually, even heavy infestations have little impact on plant growth, but sooty mold can be a problem for some crops. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Natural antagonists for cabbage whiteflies are ladybugs, predatory bugs, hoverflies and lacewing larvae.

Moreover, leaves of Brassica plants waxy and this makes them difficult to treat with pesticide sprays. In case of severe infestations and the appearance of sooty mold, insecticides containing  deltamethrin,  cypermethrin or lambda-cyhalothrin could be used.
