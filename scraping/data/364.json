With the development of the disease (primarily on the lower leaf surface) the spots elongate parallel to the leaf venation. They enlarge up to 20 mm in length and one to three mm in width. They also turn into orange-brown or red-brown flecks with a slight but definite chlorotic halo. Later, the rust pustules fuse. This leads to rupture of the leaf epidermis and the development of necrotic areas. Lesions are usually more abundant closer to the leaf tip and decrease in number toward the base.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              98 % relative humidity and cool nights followed by warm days with temperatures between 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C favour Common Rust.
