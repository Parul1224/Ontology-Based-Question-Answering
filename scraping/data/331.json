While feeding, they produce abundant quantities of sticky honeydew that drops on and coats nearby leaves and fruits with a thick black mass. The honeydew may attract attendant ants and is rapidly colonized by sooty molds that thrive on the sugary deposits, thus reducing photosynthetic rates. Badly affected leaves may fall prematurely. The older insects are conspicuous as dark gray or brown-to-black lumps on leaf undersides and stems.\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Black scale adult females are about 5 mm in diameter and dark brown or black with a prominent H-shaped ridge on the back. They migrate to twigs and branches later in autumn, and remain there for the rest of their lives. Young scales (crawlers) are yellow to orange and are found on the leaves and twigs of trees. They disperse by walking or sometimes wind-borne and settle along the leaf veins on the underside of leaves or on young shoots. They thrive in dense, unpruned portions of trees, mostly on the northern side. By contrast, open, airy trees rarely support populations of black scale. They have one or two generations per year in unfavorable settings, reaching two in irrigated orchards. Alternative hosts include citrus, pistachio, pear, stone fruit trees and pomegranate. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Some parasitic wasps, including Scutellista caerulea, Diversinervus elegans and Metaphycus helvolus, as well as some species of ladybirds (Chilocorus bipustulatus) can decimate black scale populations in the right settings.
