Leaves gradually show signs of curling before drying completely and shedding. Severe incidences result in \u201chopper burn\u201d injury and death of leaves, eventually leading to the stunting of young plants. The fruiting capacity of the plants infested at later stages of growth is significantly affected and in many cases cause lower yields and poor quality of the fibers. Before becoming necrotic, leaves may show higher trichome density on the lower side of leaves and a hardening of the tissues. These traits confers some degree of resistance against the insect in that it makes ovoposition and movements more difficult. However, it has a negative effect on the agronomic performance.\n            "}
