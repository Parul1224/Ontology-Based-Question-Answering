Both adults and nymphs attack young rice plants, causing symptoms known as \"Dead Heart\" and \"White Heads\". \"Dead Heart\" refers to the death of the young tillering leaves and in some cases of the entire stem. The same type of symptom can also be caused by some moths of the genus Diatraea. In the flowering stage, the insect attacks the panicle and cause a symptom called \"white panicle\" or \"white head\", due to the poisoning of the grains as T. limbativentris sucks the leaf sap as the panicle develops. If there is no control and the outbreak is high, loss of up to 80% can be reached.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the rice stalk stinkbug Tibraca limbativentris. It is native of Central and South America and beside rice, it also attacks soybean, tomato, and wheat. Normally, he spends the period between harvests outside the field, returning when new planting is done. Both adult and nymphs feed on plants, causing a condition known as white heads and dead hearts. These symptoms refer to the damage to the grains and the stems respectively. The injury is greater in rice grown under dry conditions or low humidity. The lack of water makes it possible for the insects to remain at the base of the plants. As the crop matures, the hardening (lignification) of the stems hinders the feeding of the insect, and its population gradually diminishes.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              The eggs are parasitized by species of Telenomus.
