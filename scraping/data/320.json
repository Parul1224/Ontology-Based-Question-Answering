The infection of blossoms can take place early in the season and the pathogen remains latent in the developing fruits. A soft brown or dark brown rot gradually develops on the fruit. This is followed by the appearance of gray to tan pustules on its surface, especially if the fruit was wounded previously or if humid weather conditions are prevailing. In low humidity, pustules may not develop at all and the fruit eventually shrivels.  Infected blossoms and leaves turn brown and wither, producing a typical blighted appearance. Stem infections lead to brown, collapsed areas (cankers), often  with exudation of surface gum. Gray specks, corresponding to fungal structures, also appear on these infected tissues under humid conditions.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the fungus Monilinia fruticola and partly by the related species M. laxa and M. fructigena. The former tends to occur more often on peaches and nectarines, whereas the latter fungi favor apricots, plum, cherry and almonds. Even though apple and pear trees can also be affected by these fungi, in these trees it is mainly M. fructigena that causes this kind of symptoms. The fungus overwinters in the mummified fruits in the tree or the orchard floor, or in twig cankers. In spring, it resumes growth, produces and release spores that will then infect healthy blossoms, fruits and twigs during the whole season. The usual entry points are either wounds on the tissues or, in the case of fruits, infected blossoms. In the latter case, the pathogen remain latent during fruit development and impact may not be seen until the fruits reach maturity. Warm temperature and prolonged periods of leaf wetness are conducive for spore release and infection and lead thus to greater disease incidence. Crop losses due to the disease can occur pre- or postharvest, during storage or transportation. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              Various alternative methods have been tried for postharvest control.
