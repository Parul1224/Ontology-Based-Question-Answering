Gradually, these spots increase in size and develop narrow yellow margins. The center of the larger spots dries and pale brown areas extend to the edge of the leaf blade, beyond the yellow margin. This gives the spots the appearance of an inverted \u2018V\u2019 shaped. On fruits, black discoloration first appear at the fruit tip and later progresses along the fruit with the formation of irregular dark spots or speckles, sometimes with yellowish margins.

It is present in dead banana leaves and produces new inoculum during periods of rain and dew. As the humidity declines, the spores are violently discharged and eventually become airborne. This makes the spread of the disease rapid in conditions in which high air humidity is directly followed by periods of air dryness. The spread of the fungus is also favored in closely planted fields. The fungus causes destruction to the plant tissue, which in turn  causes considerable reduction in the photosynthetic area and yield loss.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              No known biological control is known for this disease.
