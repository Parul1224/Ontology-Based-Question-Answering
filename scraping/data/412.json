As the deficiency becomes more severe, stems become abnormally thick and an increase in tillering occurs. New shoots may have a water-soaked appearance and may wither or die. Heads are extremely short with very few grains and, if present, awns are often twisted.

Soils with low organic matter content (<1.5%), sandy soils (prone to nutrient leaching) or highly weathered soils are susceptible to this deficiency. Alkaline soils and excess liming can also affect the availability of boron negatively. In those cases, the application of this nutrient may not correct the deficiency because it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. The micronutrient is not very mobile, this is why the first symptoms appear on new leaves. Boron deficiency is more likely in plants suffering from a water deficit or receiving little rainfall. Wheat is particularly susceptible to boron deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              A compost mix of animal manure and leaves is ideal to provide plants with organic matter and nutrients such as sulfur and boron.

Yearly soil applications can be easily leached from acidic, sandy soils. Continued application of boron may be necessary in those cases. However, excess boron may result in toxicity, so it is best to aim for the lowest effective rate, which may be further reduced on subsequent crops. Foliar applications act rapidly but timing of application is important to avoid irreversible damage. Leaves of many plants can also be damaged by direct boron application. Therefore, when in doubt, only apply to soil.
