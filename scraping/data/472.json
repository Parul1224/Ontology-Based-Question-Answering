Over time, these lesions may lead to a foliar blighting, killing large amounts of the canopy and predisposing plants to stalk rots. Dark, water-soaked spots (\u2018freckles\u2019) develop in the lesions. Leaf margins are often becoming necrotic. Shiny areas of dried bacterial ooze are often present on the lesions. In plants with stalk infection, orange vascular bundles may be seen in the stalk. If the infection takes place during the seedling phase, it leads to a  blight of the young plants with wilting and death of seedlings in some areas. \n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis, which overwinters in infected corn residues or debris of other host plants, including green foxtail, barnyardgrass and shattercane. From this infected tissues, the bacteria are transferred to growing plants primarily by splashing rain, wind-borne drops of overhead irrigation. Goss\u2019s wilt primarily infects leaves that have been wounded, for example, by hail, sand-blasting, and strong storms. The disease spreads within the plant following leaf infection, and can then be transmitted from plant to plant. Disease development is favored by warm temperatures (>25 \u00b0C). Symptoms often become most visible after silking, and increase in severity after that stage. The disease is favored by planting susceptible hybrids, reduced tillage, and monocultures corn-on-corn.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              There are no biological control options available for C. michiganensis at the moment.
