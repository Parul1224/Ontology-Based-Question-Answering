High temperatures and humidity in general will increase the possibility of injury from pesticides (insecticides and fungicides; especially soaps, oils and sulfur compounds). Cool damp weather in turn may increase the chance of injury by copper fungicides. Spray applications should be applied during calm, dry and cool conditions. Most pesticides are best applied below 25\u00b0 C. Environmental of biotic stress (drought,  insect injury) predispose plants to chemical damage. Hot, humid, and overcast weather, leading to poor drying conditions can also make plants that are otherwise resistant much more susceptible. \n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              When insects or diseases seriously damage vegetable plants, sometimes it is best to cut off the damaged parts or re-plant and learn how to prevent the problem next time. \n\n            ", "\u0c30\u0c38\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c28 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23\n": "\n              There are no chemcial control options available for pesticide burn.
