The spread of the disease follows a top-to-bottom pattern. Young leaves may show small, dark-brown spots that gradually grow, sometimes forming concentric rings. As they coalesce, they cover large patches of the blade, eventually leading to necrosis of the tissues. Dark brown streaks may be visible on stems and petioles. Growing tips are usually severely affected with systemic necrosis. Plants show stunted growth or may exhibit one-sided growth. Severely infected plants bear immature tomatoes with mottled, light green rings and raised centers. On ripe, red fruits, striking brown rings accompanied by chlorotic spots and blotches makes fruits unmarketable.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is transmitted by various species of thrips, including the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) and the chili thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis). TSWV is also active in the thrips vector, and can transmit it persistently. Nymphs that acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants will retain the ability to transmit it for the remainder of their lives. However, TSWV cannot be passed from infected females to the eggs.
