This causes a pale stippling and bleaching on the upper leaf surface that can become very obvious by mid to late summer. While they feed, they foul the underside of leaves with specks of dark excrement, that sometimes drips onto pavement and other surfaces beneath infested trees. A prolonged exposure of almond trees to high populations of poplar lace bugs may cause premature leaf drop (or defoliation) and a reduction in plant growth. The symptoms caused by this pest are not unique. Certain other true bugs and thrips also produce leaf stippling and dark excrement. Mite infestations do show stippling but not dark excrement, and rather display mite cast skins and fine silken webbing. Examining trees with a magnifying glass can help identify the cause of the symptoms.\n            ", "\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c4d": "\n              The symptoms are caused by the poplar lace bug Monosteira unicostata. Adults are about 3 mm long and have  forewings with numerous, semitransparent cells that give the body a lace-like appearance. They can overwinter as eggs in leaves on evergreen hosts or as adults in protected locations, such as under bark plates and fallen leaves or other debris beneath the trees. With the arrival of the spring they emerge and recover their activity, settling on the leaves. Female insert tiny, oblong eggs, in isolation or in groups, close to the main veins on the underside of leaves and cover them with dark excrement. Nymphs appear at 10-18 days, forming colonies and feeding gregariously by piercing and sucking the leaf sap. They reach adulthood after about 10 days, passing through five nymphal states. All life stages can be present throughout the year on evergreen hosts in areas with mild winters. Lace bugs develop through egg, nymph, and adult life stage, and have several generations a year.\n            ", "\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f": "\n              In orchards with a history of infestation with this pest, inspect plants about once a week beginning of late winter.
