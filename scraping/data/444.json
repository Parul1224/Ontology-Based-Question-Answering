Feeding takes place along the leaf axis and large patches of tissue are removed, including the slightly harder veins. The damage is similar to that caused by the rice skipper and the green semilooper, so it is essential to detect the caterpillar to differentiate these species.

These insects are found in all rice environments and they are most common in rainfed areas. Adults are large golden brown butterflies with characteristic eyespots on the wings. Notably, they are not attracted to light traps. Females lay shiny, pearl-like eggs individually in rows on rice leaves. The larvae blend easily with the rice foliage because of their body's yellow green color, which is also covered by small and yellow bead-like hairs. They have two prominent brown horns on their head that give them their common name. They feed on alternate hosts that may also support their continuous development in the field. Pupation occurs on the leaves. Greenhorned caterpillars are minor pests of rice.
