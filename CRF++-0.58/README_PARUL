Now we have to train the model



We have training set named as "crf_train.txt" which we have to train for our model


For that we need template file which is "crf1_template.txt"


And the test set is "test_set4.txt"


Now run the command for training:
Enter the terminal:
Enter the directory CRF++ 0.58
write: "bash crf_learn -t crf1_template.txt crf_train.txt model"   [MOdel in text format]


now write :ls model*


To see the model write "vim model.txt"


Now the model is trained and we have to test it against our set



now write :"bash crf_test -m model test_set4.txt>op4.txt"


The labels are assigned and then we have output in op4.txt with keywords labelled as SELECT for each question



So the keywords can be extracted for any test set.
